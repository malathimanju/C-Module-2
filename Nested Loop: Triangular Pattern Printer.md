## Nested Loop:Triangular Pattern Printer in C
## Aim
To write a C program that prints a triangular pattern of $ symbols using nested loops based on a user-defined value n.

## Algorithm
Declare variables n, i, and j.

Read the value of n from the user.

Use a for loop to iterate i from n to 1.

Inside the outer loop, use another for loop to iterate j from 1 to i and print "$".

After each inner loop, print a newline character (\n) to move to the next line.

## Program
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n, i, j;
    printf("Enter the number of rows: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
        for (j = 1; j <= i; j++) 
        {
            printf("$");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

```
